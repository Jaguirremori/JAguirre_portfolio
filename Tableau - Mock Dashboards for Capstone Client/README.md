I was a project lead for a team of 6 students for an integrated capstone course. Our client was a county-wide parks and recreation department. We were tasked with developing surveys that data analytics would be applied to in order to bring new insights to the organization. Mock data was made based on potential responses for the surveys and these visualizations were made from said mock data and presented to various stakeholders within the organization.
